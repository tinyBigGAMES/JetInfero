VirtusTotal report for JetInfero Project
========================================

We are pleased to include a VirusTotal report for this project to ensure
transparency and trust. Every effort is made to deliver software that is both
safe and free of viruses. However, despite our rigorous testing and security
measures, there is always a possibility that virus scanners may flag the files
as a false positive. We appreciate your understanding and encourage you to
review the VirusTotal report for your assurance. Should you have any concerns
or reservations, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.
